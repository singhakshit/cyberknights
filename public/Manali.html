                         panoramic views of the Pir Panjal range. Open only from May to November 
                         due to heavy snowfall, the pass is a must-visit for its adventurous terrain
                          and breathtaking photo ops. Visitors enjoy snow activities and experience the
                           transition from lush green Manali to the stark beauty of Lahaul. 
                           Rohtang Pass, located in Himachal Pradesh, India, is a stunning high-altitude 
                           mountain pass in the eastern Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas. Situated at 
                           an elevation of approximately 3,978 meters (13,051 feet), it connects the lush
                            Kullu Valley with the arid Lahaul and Spiti Valleys. The pass is about 51 
                            kilometers from Manali and is a popular destination for adventure seekers and 
                            nature enthusiasts.Known for its breathtaking views, Rohtang Pass offers a 
                            natural divide between two distinct cultures and landscapes. On one side lies
                             the verdant Kullu Valley, while the other leads to the stark, high-altitude 
                             deserts of Lahaul and Spiti. The pass is open from May to November, as heavy
                              snowfall makes it inaccessible during winter.Visitors can enjoy activities 
                              like skiing, snowboarding, and mountain biking, along with capturing panoramic
                               views of snow-capped peaks and meandering rivers. However, the journey to 
                               Rohtang Pass is challenging due to unpredictable weather and narrow roads. 
                               Permits are required to visit, and environmental concerns have led to 
                               restrictions to preserve its fragile ecosystem.Rohtang Pass is not just a
                                gateway but an unforgettable experience for those venturing into the Himalayas.

                        <p>Hidimba Devi Temple, also known as Dhungari Temple, is a revered Hindu shrine located in Manali, 
                            Himachal Pradesh, India. This ancient temple, dedicated to Hidimba Devi, the wife of Bhima from the 
                            Indian epic Mahabharata, is nestled amidst a dense cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foothills
                             of the Himalayas. Built in 1553 by Maharaja Bahadur Singh, the temple is a remarkable example of 
                             traditional Himachali architecture.The temple is constructed around a cave where Hidimba Devi is believed
                              to have meditated. Unlike conventional temples, it does not house an idol but features a large rock that
                               is worshipped as the deity. The temple's unique pagoda-style architecture includes intricately carved 
                               wooden doors and a 24-meter-tall tower with three square roofs covered in timber tiles and a fourth brass
                                cone-shaped roof at the top. The carvings depict scenes from Hindu mythology, animals, dancers, and foliate
                                 designs.Hidimba Devi Temple holds significant cultural and spiritual importance in Manali. During Navaratri,
                                  the focus shifts from Goddess Durga to Hidimba Devi, and the temple becomes a hub of devotion and festivities.
                                   The annual Dhungari Mela celebrates the arrival of spring and attracts locals and tourists alike.Nearby, a 
                                   shrine dedicated to Ghatotkacha, the son of Hidimba and Bhima, adds to the temple's historical and mythological
                                    allure. Surrounded by towering deodar trees, the temple offers a serene and mystical ambiance, making it a 
                                    must-visit destination for travelers exploring the beauty and heritage of Himachal Pradesh. Its blend of natural
                                     charm, architectural splendor, and mythological significance creates an unforgettable experience.</p>
